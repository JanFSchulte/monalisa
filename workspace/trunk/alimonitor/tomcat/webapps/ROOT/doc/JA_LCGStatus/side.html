Plots in this page describe the LCG states of JobAgents at a given site, according to several information sources. <br>
<br>
Please note that LCG states (that actually apply to JobAgents, not to jobs themselves) do not map exactly onto AliEn ones; you can find a 
description of all LCG states here:<br>

In addition to all available LCG states, one more series ('ShortRunning') is shown that does not correspond to a legitimate LCG state. These are JobAgents that finish correctly (from the LCG point of 
view) with or without a nonzero exit code, after having run for less than three minutes.<br>
<br>
The 'Timings' series keep track of the time it takes for a JobAgent to get to the LRMS ('TimeToQueue'), and the time spent in the 'Waiting' status ('TimeWaiting'). Large values for TimeWaiting (and a large number of jobs in the 'Waiting' status) often mean that the RB is stuck.<br><br>
<b><u>INFORMATION SOURCES</u></b>:<br>
<br>
<b>LocalDB</b> and <b>LDBTimings</b>: This is the result of a query to the LB (a component of the Resource Broker) about all JobAgents listed as ACTIVE or QUEUED (not DEAD ones) in the local JOBAGENT DB on the VO-Box.<br>
<br>
<b>LastLogged</b> and <b>LLTimings</b>: This is the result of a similar query to the LB about the last 200 JobAgents submitted by the VO-Box, regardlessly whether they're in the VO-Box DB or not. Some discrepancy between this two first plots 
is expected, specially after changes in the running conditions. Check here for large number of 'Aborted' JAs, that may mean problems in the LCG CE and/or the RB or BDII<br>
<br>
<b>LocalGRIS</b>: This is a query directly to the CE GRIS (and not the site BDII). Only 'Scheduled' (i.e. queued on the batch system) and 'Running' Jobagents are listed there, since the GRIS does periodically a 'qstat' (or the equivalent) and publishes this information. The name of the CE is taken from the AliEn configuration.<br>
<br>
<b>BDII</b>: This is a query to a top-level BDII (the default is the one pointed at by $$LCG_GFAL_INFOSYS variable on the VO-Box, but is configurable). These should be the same numbers as above, given some latency since the BDII is actually essentially a cache for info from GRISes.
