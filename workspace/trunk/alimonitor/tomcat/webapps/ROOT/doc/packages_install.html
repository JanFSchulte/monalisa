<p>For Linux you can use the same binary packages that are available on Grid. This is an automated method of installing the latest stable version of AliEn, the selected package and all its dependencies. </p><p>By clicking the Linux link for the package you will get an installation script. Save it on disk in a location that has enough free space to install the package and its dependencies (in other words, avoid AFS if your home directory is on it). </p><p>The script is called <em>install-VO_ALICE@&lt;Package&gt;::&lt;Version&gt;.sh</em>. First make it executable: </p><p><em>chmod a+x ./install-VO_ALICE@&lt;Package&gt;::&lt;Version&gt;.sh</em></p><p>then run it:</p><p><em>./install-VO_ALICE@&lt;Package&gt;::&lt;Version&gt;.sh</em></p><p>The script will download the tarballs in the <em>download</em> subfolder relative to where the script is located, then will unpack everything in the <em>packages</em> subfolder. If everything went ok you can remove the <em>download</em> folder to reclaim disk space.</p><p>If you install ROOT or AliRoot you will get one or two scripts that set the correct environment to run the applications : <em>env_root.sh</em> and <em>env_aliroot.sh</em>. Simply source the one that you need and the enviroment to run the latest version of each will be set up.</p><p>There are very few dependencies on the system, but depending on your system you might miss libgfortran and/or libreadline5. On *Ubuntu please run this first to make sure you have them:</p><p><em>sudo apt-get install libreadline5 libgfortran3 g++<br /></em></p><p>More detailed instructions are available here :&nbsp; <a href="http://aaf.cern.ch/node/81" target="_blank">http://aaf.cern.ch/node/81</a></p>
