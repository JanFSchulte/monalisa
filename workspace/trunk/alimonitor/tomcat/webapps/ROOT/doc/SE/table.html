<p><strong>Demotion factor</strong></p><p>This column shows how much the respective SE is being demoted. The higher the factor the further away it seems to be to the client using the SE discovery mechanism. For example 30% makes a local storage appear like being in another country while more than 50% makes it appear like it's on a different continent. Getting close to 100% will essentially not include the storage in a reply list any more.</p><p>&nbsp;The factor is calculated based on the number of successful tests (OK) from the total number of tests (ALL):</p><p>factor=(OK(last day) / ALL(last day)) * 75 + (OK(last week) / ALL(last week)) * 25;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The storage capacity is reported in TeraBytes (TB) with 1024^4 base, equal to Tebibytes (TiB). </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
